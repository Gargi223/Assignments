# **Assignment 1: ATM Machine Using OOPs in java**  

## **Objective**  
Implement an ATM machine simulation using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** in Java. The program should provide users with four options:  

1. **Check Current Balance** – Displays the current balance of user.  
2. **Deposit Money** – Allows the user to enter an amount to add to their balance.  
3. **Withdraw Money** – Allows the user to enter an amount to deduct from their balance (ensure sufficient funds).  
4. **Exit** – Stops the program.  

After performing an operation, the user should be presented with the same options again until they choose to exit.
